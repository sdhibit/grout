## General Settings

This sub-menu contains general display and download settings.

### Box Art

When set to show, Grout displays cover art thumbnails next to game names in the game list. Artwork is
automatically cached in the background as you browse. This provides a visual preview similar to your frontend's game
library view.

### Downloaded Games

Controls how already-downloaded games appear in game lists:

- **Do Nothing** - No special treatment for downloaded games
- **Mark** - Downloaded games are marked with a download icon
- **Filter** - Downloaded games are hidden from the list entirely

### Download Art

When enabled, Grout downloads box art for games after downloading the ROMs. The art goes into your
artwork directory so your frontend can display it.

### Download Art Kind

Controls which type of artwork is downloaded when Download Art is enabled. This option is only visible when
Download Art is set to True.

- **Default** - Uses the default artwork provided by RomM
- **Box2D** - 2D box art scans
- **Box3D** - 3D box art renders
- **MixImage** - Composite mix images combining multiple artwork types

### Download Screenshot Preview (muOS)

When enabled, Grout also downloads a screenshot preview image for each game. Only visible on muOS when Download Art
is enabled.

### Download Splash Art (muOS)

Downloads splash art shown when launching a game. Choose **None**, **Marquee**, or **Title**. Only visible on muOS
when Download Art is enabled.

### EmulationStation Art Options

On EmulationStation-based CFWs (Batocera, Knulli, ROCKNIX, ArkOS), enabling Download Art reveals additional per-asset
options:

- **Download Game Thumbnail** - None / Box2D / Box3D
- **Download Marquee Image** - None / Marquee / Logo
- **Download Game Video** - True / False
- **Download Game Bezel** - True / False
- **Download Game Manual** - True / False
- **Download Game Box back** - True / False
- **Download Game Fan Art** - True / False

### Archived Downloads

Controls what happens when downloading archived ROM files (zip and 7z):

- **Uncompress** - Grout automatically extracts archived ROMs after downloading. The archive is deleted after extraction.
- **Do Nothing** - Keep the downloaded archive as-is without extracting.

### Language

Grout is localized! Choose from English, Deutsch, Espanol, Francais, Italiano, Portugues, Russian, or
Japanese. If you notice an issue with a translation or want to help by translating, please let us know!

### Swap Face Buttons

Swaps the confirm and cancel buttons (`A`/`B`). Useful on devices where the physical button layout doesn't match
Grout's default mapping.

---

## Collections Settings

This sub-menu contains all collection-related configuration.

### Collections

When set to show, Grout displays regular collections in the main menu.

### Smart Collections

When set to show, Grout displays smart collections in the main menu.

### Virtual Collections

When set to show, Grout displays virtual collections in the main menu.

### Collection View

Controls how collections display their games:

- **Platform** - After selecting a collection, you'll see a platform selection screen showing all platforms in that
  collection. Select a platform to view games from only that platform.
- **Unified** - After selecting a collection, you'll immediately see all games from all platforms with platform slugs
  shown as prefixes (e.g., `[nes] Tecmo Bowl`, `[snes] Super Mario World`)

---

## Directory Mappings

Opens the platform directory mapping screen, which is the same screen shown during initial setup. This lets you change
which device directories are mapped to which RomM platforms.

For each platform, you can select:

- **Skip** - Don't map this platform. Games from this platform won't be available to download.
- **Create {Directory Name}** - Create a new directory for this platform. Grout suggests directory names that match your
  custom firmware's expected structure.
- **/{Existing Directory}** - Map to an existing directory on your device.
- **Custom...** - Enter a custom folder name using the on-screen keyboard.

For detailed documentation on platform mapping, see the [User Guide](guide.md#platform-directory-mapping).

### Mappings Reference

Each CFW uses different folder naming conventions:

--8<-- "docs/_includes/mappings-reference.md"

---

## ES-DE Settings

*(Only shown when running on ES-DE — vanilla, EmuDeck, or RetroDECK.)*

### Variant

Which ES-DE flavor you are running. This selects the default directory layout:

- **ES-DE** - Standalone ES-DE. ROMs default to `~/ROMs`, gamelists and media to `~/ES-DE`.
- **EmuDeck** - Directories under `~/Emulation` (or your custom EmuDeck install root, read from
  EmuDeck's `settings.sh`), with media in `~/Emulation/tools/downloaded_media`.
- **RetroDECK** - Directories under `~/retrodeck`, with relocated folders read from
  RetroDECK's `retrodeck.json`.

### Directory Overrides

Each row shows the currently effective path. Select a row to edit it with the on-screen keyboard;
clear the text to return to the variant default (or auto-discovered path).

- **Base Path** - The install root (useful for SD-card installs).
- **ROMs Directory**, **BIOS Directory**, **Saves Directory** - Individual content directories.
- **ES-DE Data Directory** - Where ES-DE keeps `gamelists/` (and by default `downloaded_media/`).
- **Media Directory** - The root of ES-DE's `downloaded_media` tree.

---

## Add-on Folders

Modern consoles (Nintendo Switch, PS3, Vita, 3DS, Wii U, …) ship games as a **base
game** plus optional **updates** and **DLC**. When your RomM library stores these in
`update/` and `dlc/` subfolders, RomM tags each file's role and Grout treats the entry
as one game rather than a flat list of files.

### Downloading a multi-part game

Open the game and press Download. If it has updates or DLC, Grout shows an **Add-on
picker**:

- The **base game always downloads**.
- Each **update** and **DLC** is a checkbox, **pre-checked** — leave them to get
  everything, or uncheck what you don't want.
- **A** toggles an item, **L1**/**R1** select none/all, **Start** downloads.

By default add-ons download into a category subfolder next to the base game
(`<rom folder>/update/`, `<rom folder>/dlc/`).

### Changing where updates/DLC land

Some emulators watch a dedicated folder for updates/DLC so you don't have to install
them to internal storage. The **Add-on Folders** screen lists each add-on-capable
platform (Switch, PS3, Vita, 3DS, Wii U, …) — much like Directory Mappings. Select a
platform to open **its own screen**, where each row is a left/right **cycle** just like
Rom Directory Mapping (press **A** to pick from the list instead):

- **Base Folder** — the root the category folders live under. Cycles between the
  platform's **ROM directory** (default, pre-filled from whatever your firmware uses —
  this is not tied to any particular firmware or emulator) and **Custom…**, which opens
  the on-screen keyboard. A leading `~` expands to your home directory. Left at the ROM
  directory, the base tracks your ROMs automatically.
- **A row per supplemental add-on category** (Update, DLC, Patch) — each cycles
  **Skip / default-subfolder / Custom…**, exactly like a platform maps to
  Skip / `/gb` / Custom. (Standalone alternate builds such as hacks and prototypes are
  not add-ons — they're offered as selectable **versions** on the game screen and
  download straight into the ROM folder.)
  - **Skip** — drop that category's files directly into the Base Folder (no dedicated
    subfolder). The files still download; they just aren't foldered separately.
  - **default** — a subfolder named after the category (`/update`, `/dlc`, …),
    relative to the Base Folder.
  - **Custom…** — any other subfolder relative to the Base Folder.

So a Switch update lands at `<Base Folder>/<Update subfolder>/…` — for example
`~/Emulation/roms/switch/update/…` by default, or a custom emulator folder if you set
one. Any value left at its default is not stored, so folders keep tracking your ROM
directory as it changes.

## Save Sync Settings

This sub-menu configures save synchronization. For complete save sync documentation, see the [Save Sync Guide](save-sync.md).

### Device Name

Register or rename this device with your RomM server. Each device needs a unique name so RomM can track which saves
belong to which device. Selecting this opens a keyboard to enter or change the device name. Until a device is
registered, this sub-menu shows a single **Register Device** entry instead.

### Save Mapping

Configure which emulator save directory is used for each platform (the screen is titled "Save Sync Mappings"). This
tells Grout where to find and place save files on your device. Only platforms with more than one emulator save
directory are listed.

### Save Backups

Controls how many backup copies of local saves are retained when a newer save is downloaded from the server:

- **5** / **10** / **15** - Keep the N most recent backups per game
- **No Limit** - Keep all backups (default)

Backups are stored in a `.backup/` directory within each platform's save directory.

---

## Tools

This sub-menu contains artwork management and parental controls.

### Download Missing Art

Scans all mapped platforms and downloads cover art for any games that don't already have cached artwork. Useful after
adding new games to your library.

Note that this artwork is only displayed within Grout's interface - it does not affect the artwork shown in your CFW's
game list.

### Kid Mode

Hides some of the more advanced features for a simplified experience. When enabled, Kid Mode will hide:

- The Settings screen
- The Save Sync screen
- The Game Options screen
- The BIOS download screen

**Temporary Override:** You can temporarily disable Kid Mode for a single session by pressing `L1` + `R1` + `Menu` during the Grout splash screen.

**Permanent Disable:** Return to this menu and turn off Kid Mode.

---

## Advanced Settings

This sub-menu contains advanced configuration and system settings.

### Preload Artwork

Pre-cache artwork for all games across all mapped platforms. Grout scans your platforms, identifies
games without cached artwork, and downloads cover art from RomM. Useful for pre-caching after adding new games.

Use `Left/Right` to choose **Missing Only** or **All**, then press `A` to continue. On the platform picker, `A`
toggles platforms and `Start` begins the download.

Note that this artwork is only displayed within Grout's interface - it does not affect the artwork shown in your CFW's game list.

### Rebuild Cache

Completely rebuilds the local cache from scratch. This deletes the SQLite database and re-downloads all platform
and game data from RomM. Use this if you're experiencing cache issues or want a clean slate.

Use `Left/Right` to choose what to rebuild — **Metadata**, **Artwork**, or **All** — then press `A` to continue or
`B` to cancel.

> [!NOTE]
> Under normal operation, you shouldn't need to use this. Grout automatically syncs the cache in the background
> each time you launch the app, using incremental updates to only fetch data that has changed since the last sync.
> A sync icon appears in the status bar during this process.

### Download Timeout

How long Grout waits for a single ROM to download before giving up. Useful for large files or
slow connections. Options range from 15 to 120 minutes.

### API Timeout

How long Grout waits for responses from your RomM server before giving up. If you have a slow
connection or are a completionist with a heavily loaded server, increase this. Options range from 15 to 300 seconds.

### Server Address

Change the protocol, hostname, or port of your RomM server without logging out. Useful if your server's address
changes or you need to switch between HTTP and HTTPS.

### Release Channel

Controls which release channel Grout uses for updates:

- **Match RomM** - Automatically matches the release channel of your RomM server
- **Stable** - Only receive stable releases
- **Beta** - Receive beta releases for early access to new features

### Log Level

Controls the verbosity of Grout's log output:

- **Debug** - Maximum detail, useful for troubleshooting issues
- **Info** - Standard logging with sync completion summaries and key events
- **Error** - Only log errors

### Input Mapping

Launches an interactive capture flow: press and hold each button when prompted to build a custom control mapping for
your device. The mapping is saved to `input_mapping.json`, and Grout restarts to apply it.

### Reset Input Mapping

Deletes the custom input mapping and restores default controls. Only shown when a custom mapping exists. Grout exits
after resetting so the change takes effect on the next launch.
